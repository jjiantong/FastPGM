FastBN: Fast Parallel Bayesian Network Learning and Inference
=============================================================

**FastBN** is an open-source C++ library that aims to help practitioners easily and efficiently apply Bayesian Network
(BN) models to solve real-world problems. FastBN exploits multi-core CPUs to achieve high efficiency. Key features of
FastBN are as follows:

* Wide coverage of different tasks and algorithms related to BNs, including structure learning, parameter learning, exact inference and approximate inference.
* Support classification, through the building blocks of structure learning, parameter learning and inference.
* Support Python interfaces.
* Support BN sample generation, dataset and network format convertor, etc.

# FastBN

Fast and parallel solutions for Bayesian Network structure learning and inference (IPDPS'22, PPoPP'23)

## Overview

The aim of FastBN is to help users easily and efficiently apply Bayesian Network (BN) models to solve real-world problems. 
FastBN exploits multi-core CPUs to achieve high efficiency. 
FastBN contains:
- *Fast-BNS*: accelerated PC-stable algorithm for BN structure learning from data 
  (to learn DAGs that are well matched the observed data);
- *Fast-BNI*: accelerated junction tree algorithm for exact inference on BNs
  (given observed values of some variables in the BN, to calculate the conditional
  probability of the other variables)

## How to use

Clone the repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/jjiantong/FastBN.git
cd FastBN/lib
#under the directory of lib
git submodule init ARFF && git submodule init googletest && git submodule init tinyxml2 && git submodule init stats && git submodule init gcem && git submodule update
```

Build the project: Create a directory ```build``` under the root directory. Generate the make file and compile.
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DUSE_MPI=OFF ..
make
```

On Mac OS, the default compiler (clang) needs to be changed to g++. (You can use ```ls /usr/local/bin | grep g++``` to check the compiler. Mine is ```g++-9```.)
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++-9 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DUSE_MPI=OFF ..
make
```

Quick start.
```
./BayesianNetwork
```
By default settings, FastBN will run exact inference task using the sequential version of junction tree algorithm 
on 1000 test cases of the ALARM network. Each test case contains 20% observed variables.
Please use the following command line options when running the executable file:

- ```-a```: specify the functionality/algorithm
    ```
    0: PC-stable for structure learning; 
    2: junction tree for exact inference; 
    ```
- ```-t```: specify number of threads, default 1
- ```-g```: group size, default 1 [used in PC-stable]
- ```-f0```: provide relative path of BN file, default ```alarm/alarm.xml``` [used in inference]
- ```-f1```: provide relative path of reference BN file, default ```alarm/alarm.bif``` [used in structure learning]
- ```-f2```: provide relative path of training set file (in CSV format), default ```alarm/alarm_s5000.txt``` [used in structure learning]
- ```-f3```: provide relative path of testing set file (in LIBSVM format), default ```alarm/testing_alarm_1k_p20``` [used in inference]
- ```-f4```: provide relative path of reference potential table file, default ```alarm/alarm_1k_pt``` [used in inference]
